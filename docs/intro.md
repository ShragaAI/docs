# Getting Started

Let's discover **Shraga in less than 5 minutes**.

The API for our web application is designed around **RESTful** principles. Our API provides intuitive, resource-oriented URLs, accepts **JSON-encoded** request bodies, returns **JSON-encoded** responses, and utilizes standard HTTP response codes, authentication methods, and verbs.

Our API is versioned to ensure compatibility and allow for future enhancements. Always refer to the most recent documentation for the most up-to-date information on endpoints and functionality.

Key features of our API include:

- [**Flows Management**](../docs/flows): Create, retrieve, and execute custom flows.
- [**History Tracking**](../docs/history): Retrieve and manage chat history.
- [**Analytics**](../docs/analytics): Access analytical data about API usage and performance.
- [**Service Status**](../docs/services): Check the status of various services integrated with the API.

The API is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with consistent patterns across different endpoints. Whether you're managing flows, retrieving history, or analyzing data, our API provides the tools you need to integrate our services into your applications effectively.
