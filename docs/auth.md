# Authentication

## Get API Key

To use our API, you'll need an API key. You can obtain your API key from your account dashboard. Once you have your API key, you should include it in the header of all API requests to authenticate your account and gain access to the API.

Here's an example of how to include your API key in a request header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Keep your API key confidential and secure. Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control systems.


## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.shraga.com/v1
```
